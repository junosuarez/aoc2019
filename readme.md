# advent of code 2019

i'm starting it a little late.

i intend to try to complete it in rust.
(i have never programmed a line of rust in my life).

i will complete each problem in a directory corresponding to the day,
and i will attempt to take notes here as i go.

## day 1

time to get going. i:

- i made this repo
- i installed rust following https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started
- i installed the rust (rls) vscode extension (`ext install rust-lang.rust`). I want to learn [more of their tricks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust) as i go

i tried running `cargo new 1` but learned names starting with numbers are not supported by default. i had planned on having my directory names be simply the numbers, but i'd rather not use non-standard names so i reran it as `cargo new day`. this made a directory named `/day1` containing a `Cargo.toml` file (package manifest, similar to a package.json) and a `src` directory with a `main.rs` file containing a hello world function. that's nice!

the rust getting started page said i should be able to run `cargo run` to compile and run (this is nice), but doing so gave me a compiler error:

</details>

the note at the bototm looks helpful: `invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun`

I'm running this on my home laptop, which has a bunch of mishmasshed develoepr tools, but apparently not the xcode cli tools. i recently updated to macOs catalina, so maybe that's it.

i can install this easily enough, but it would have been nice if the rust installer had warned me about this, or if the compiler had given me a note about how to install them:

`xcode-select --install`

this took a long time, about 5 minutes, and i'm not sure why. computers are complicated at the end of the 2010s.

now i can successfully do `cargo run` and it prints some information and then, finally, the program output: Hello world!

i'm going to be running me code a lot during this, i think- can i get it to print a plain stdout without the build info?

i try `cargo help run` and behold, it works (thanks, modern cli subcommand conventions!) and i might have a flag `--q -q No output printed to stdout`

and sure enough `cargo run -q` gives me what i want: only the program output. also, since the program was already compiled this time, it was super fast. `cargo run` (without the flag) confirms that it skipped recompilation. this is a nice touch. modern toolchains are nice.

let's see what it wrote to disk:

- i've got a `Cargo.lock` file (which I assume corresponds to a package.lock or yarn.lock file - I'll set aside package management for now and dig more into Cargo packages aka "crates" later. I'm a bit miffed that these files are capitalized, but I guess it doesn't matter.)
- I've got a `/target` directory alongside my `/src` directory, with a `/debug` subdir. i noticed "debug" in the output from the earlier `cargo run` command, so presumably it's a binary with some extra debugger hooks, and presumably there's ways to target an optimized or production build.
- inside the `/target/debug` there's a whole bunch that I didn't expect. I'll ignore trying to figure out what everything is, but it looks like i've got an executable binary at `/target/debug/day1`. i'll add `target` to my gitignore for this repo. maybe there are better rust conventions- i'll learn them later.

sure enough, running `target/debug/day1` gives me my program output.

okay, this was exciting! let's crack the first aoc challenge. first, though, i'm going to rename day1 to day01 so i can get proper lexicographical sorting past day 9. since i haven't really done anything, i'm just going to `rm -rf day1` and `cargo new day01`.

now, day 1: https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1

### Part 1

this is implementing a simple math formula. i know no rust. but, i've heard how good it's compiler error messages are, and that it's somewhat C-like. so, naively, i implement it basically like javascript, taking a cue from the scaffolded hello world from `cargo new`:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!(getRequiredFuel(12));
}

fn getRequiredFuel(mass) {
  return Math.floor(mass / 3) - 2
}
```

and i immediately get a ton of errors! but let's see if i can work through from the compiler and teach myself what it should be.

first:

```
error: expected one of `:`, `@`, or `|`, found `)`
 --> src/main.rs:5:24
  |
5 | fn getRequiredFuel(mass) {
  |                        ^ expected one of `:`, `@`, or `|` here
  |
  = note: anonymous parameters are removed in the 2018 edition (see RFC 1685)
help: if this was a parameter name, give it a type
  |
5 | fn getRequiredFuel(mass: TypeName) {
  |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
help: if this is a type, explicitly ignore the parameter name
  |
5 | fn getRequiredFuel(_: mass) {
  |                    ^^^^^^^
```

this is astonishingly good. I don't know what any of the types are called, but let's try `int`. that worked! on to the next error.

```
error: format argument must be a string literal
 --> src/main.rs:2:14
  |
2 |     println!(getRequiredFuel(12));
  |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
help: you might be missing a string literal to format with
  |
2 |     println!("{}", getRequiredFuel(12));
  |              ^^^^^
```

okay, looks like I can use the string format version they provide. that takes care of that second error.

hmm, looks like `int` didn't really work, it just got rid of the verbose untyped parameter error. now i've got

```
error[E0412]: cannot find type `int` in this scope
 --> src/main.rs:5:26
  |
5 | fn getRequiredFuel(mass: int) {
  |                          ^^^ not found in this scope
```

maybe `Int`? no. `integer`? no. `Integer`? no. hmmm, a long shot, but `number`/`Number`? no. ugh. I'll have to look at _some_ docs, I guess. This should be easy though. I search `rust number` and get linked to https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html which has a handy table. Ah, rust has very specific numeric types. I'll go with a signed 32-bit integer, `i32` which would correspond to a java `int`, I think. that takes care of the paremeter type error.

now i've got left my javascripty Math.floor. i didn't really expect it to just work, but it was my first guess. i get

```
error[E0425]: cannot find value `Math` in this scope
 --> src/main.rs:6:10
  |
6 |   return Math.floor(mass / 3) - 2
  |          ^^^^ not found in this scope

```

I'm gonna have to go to docs, so i search `rust math floor` and get https://docs.rs/libmath/0.1.4/math/round/fn.floor.html

ah, i've got to import it with `use math::round;` and i also notice i've got to be explicit about the "scale" of the number type i want to rount it to, in this case i think i'll try i32. i guessed wrong from my glance at the docs! the scale parameter is a number of decimal places, not the data type. i don't want decimal places, so 0.

my code now looks like

```rust
use math::round;

fn main() {
    println!("{}", getRequiredFuel(12));
}

fn getRequiredFuel(mass: i32) {
  return round::floor(mass / 3, 0) - 2;
}
```

but my import isn't working:

```
error[E0432]: unresolved import `math`
 --> src/main.rs:1:5
  |
1 | use math::round;
  |     ^^^^ use of undeclared type or module `math`
```

hmm, I copied `use math::round;` right from the docs. one thing i notice is the `::` notation is different from what i'm used to in other languages (which would use a . or a -> to traverse a namespace). clicking around the docs i notie the page i pulled up mentions "crate". is it possible that these math functions aren't builtin to the language, and that i need to specify a dependency? sure enough clicking around gets me to https://github.com/0x022b/libmath-rs which sure looks like an open source third party package. hmm, let's verify that there really isn't a builtin. this feels like an extreme level of modularity- is this typical in rust? lower in my search results for `rust math floor` i find https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f64.html which looks promising. the number types (or 64-bit floats, anyway) have a built-in floor method. let me try:

```rust
fn getRequiredFuel(mass: i32) {
  return (mass / 3).floor() - 2;
}
```

and i get

```
error[E0599]: no method named `floor` found for type `i32` in the current scope
 --> src/main.rs:6:21
  |
6 |   return (mass / 3).floor() - 2;
  |                     ^^^^^ method not found in `i32`
```

well. what's the behavior of the plain `/` function? after some experimentation, it looks like it rounds. this is intuition i should have from other languages (C, Java), but for some reason i thought it would do what-you-learned-in-middle-school rounding (aka Half Up). silly. specifically, the behavior i saw experimentally was rounding down towards 0, eg 99/100 => 0, -99/100 => 0.

so i can remove the function call and use the basic `/` operator. i add a comment explicating the rounding behavior, giving:

```rust
fn getRequiredFuel(mass: i32) {
  // we depend on i32 rounding, which rounds the division down toward 0
  return (mass / 3) - 2;
}
```

progress! now i've got:

```
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:7:10
  |
5 | fn getRequiredFuel(mass: i32) {
  |                               - help: try adding a return type: `-> i32`
6 |   // we depend on i32 rounding, which rounds the division down toward 0
7 |   return (mass / 3) - 2;
  |          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected (), found i32
  |
  = note: expected type `()`
             found type `i32`
```

which helpfully tells me i need to document my return type. the help hint is spot on.

now my code compiles and gives the right result! ð

it looks like:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("{}", getRequiredFuel(12));
}

fn getRequiredFuel(mass: i32) -> i32 {
  // we depend on i32 rounding, which rounds the division down toward 0
  return (mass / 3) - 2;
}
```

no more errors, but i get a helpful style warning:

```
warning: function `getRequiredFuel` should have a snake case name
 --> src/main.rs:5:4
  |
5 | fn getRequiredFuel(mass: i32) -> i32 {
  |    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ help: convert the identifier to snake case: `get_required_fuel`
  |
  = note: `#[warn(non_snake_case)]` on by default

```

we're not in Java(Script) anymore! i've heard there's a rustfmt tool, let's see if that can fix it for me. i run it from my shell, and it just hangs for a while. i ctrl-c it and run `rustfmt --help`. i rerun it as `rustfmt src/main.rs` and it exits without printing anything. i try `rustfmt --check src/main.rs`, which likewise exits (code 0) without printing. my `src/main.rs` file is unchanged. looks like the printer won't fix this style warning for me.

i manually change it to:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("{}", get_required_fuel(12));
}

fn get_required_fuel(mass: i32) -> i32 {
    // we depend on i32 rounding, which rounds the division down toward 0
    return (mass / 3) - 2;
}
```

which compiles cleanly and prints my output, `2`.

i try it with the remaining examples form the puzzel. all my results are right, so now we can solve the puzzel. sometime soon i'll have to figure out tests in rust.

i've never done an aoc before, and i didnt' really read before starting, so now i realize i've got a big input file. i hate copy/pasting code, so i guess i need to figure out how to read from stdin. i noticed one of the headings form the rust book docs: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html . time to read, i guess. it says it'll reference earlier concepts, but who's got time for that? let's see what I can clean.

ah, reading command line args! https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-01-accepting-command-line-arguments.html#reading-the-argument-values let's modify the program to read the number as input and then print it. i'll need to parse it from a string to an int.

so `env::args()` will give me an "iterator" of the arguments. with the RLS extension in vscode, i get intellisense in its members, so i try `env::args().next`, in full `let x: string = env::args().next();`.

looks like i'm running into some more typing things! .next gives me an `Option<String>`. This looks familiar from Java.

RLS is great, it's giving me lots of helpful inline documentation in my editor (vscode). I fumble my way though the String.parse docs. There's a syntax called a "turbofish" and apparently type inference.

i get an error. i realize that calling `env::args().next` is giving me arg0, my binary path, instead of what i'm passing in. instead of being super hacky, let me read about converting the iterator to a collection, like the tutorial was trying to help me with: `let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();`.

after some fumbling, i have:

```rust
use std::env;

fn main() {
  let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

  let arg1 = args.get(1).expect("Missing input");
  let input: i32 = arg1.parse().unwrap();

  println!("{}", get_required_fuel(input));
}

fn get_required_fuel(mass: i32) -> i32 {
  // we depend on i32 rounding, which rounds the division down toward 0
  return (mass / 3) - 2;
}
```

which works. for now, i'm going to use some shell script to get through the first puzzel's input and
not worry about file reading, nor control flow or loops, for now.

i've got this shell script:

```sh
#! /bin/bash

INPUT=$(cat input)

SUM=0

for MASS in $INPUT; do
  FUEL_FOR_MODULE=$(target/debug/day01 $MASS)
  SUM=$(expr $FUEL_FOR_MODULE + $SUM)
done

echo $SUM
```

which gives me an answer of 3406527. and I've got the first start! ð

### Part 2

We've got recusion! Unfortunately, I think this means I can't avoid reading all of the values into my rust program any longer, but that will have to wait for my next session.

....

And, I'm back for the next session. My strategy is to get it so that we'll read line-delimited inputs from stdin, and then figure out how to do the iteration / summing in rust, rather than the bash script, and get puzzel 1 to run successfully. Then I'll tackle the second puzzel from day 1, and if I've still got time, then I'll proceed to day 2. Lots of new learning of basic stuff in this new ecosystem! I might start by reading docs, rather than just plowing ahead against the compiler like I did before.

I went back to [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-01-accepting-command-line-arguments.html#reading-the-argument-values), but this deals with reading from a file, and, for unix-yness, I'd rather read from stdin. I scanned the table of contents on the left- looks like lots of good info I should read at some point, but nothing referencing stdin, so I go back to search `rust stdin` and find https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.Stdin.html which looks promising.

The first thing I see in the stdio functions is lots of manual string buffer management. I also see a read_line method. Also, you have to explicitly lock stdin, so concurrency considerations are made explicit. It's not clear to me whether this is some sort of conventional stream interface or if it is specific to stdio. I'm going to try `while`ing `read_line` to read all of my stdin. The book had a heading called [control flow](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html), so I skim that.

Something really cool I just learned is that syntactical `loop` constructs (`loop` implies an infinite loop until an explicit `break`, which seems neat) can return a value! The example they give is

```rust
let mut counter = 0;
let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };
```

And I think that's just so dang cool. So rust has 3 kinds of looping, `loop`, `while`, and `for`, the last of which operates on iterables. It seems like it would be cleanest to treat stdin as an iterable of lines. Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. I search for `rust stdin iterable` anyway. [This stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55314607/how-to-store-an-iterator-over-stdin-in-a-structure) seems relevant, and shows that there's a `io::stdin().lock().lines()` method available, but only when I import something called `prelude::*`, which I assume is some sort of higher-order stdlib.

At this point, I've got something working, and lots of questions on things to follow up on, such as, what's a trait, and what's this `mut` and `&mut` I keep seeing? I have an idea it means mutable, and that `&` is a reference as in C, but I need to actually read about it. Also, what's `'_` in method signatures?

Now to see about parsing my lines into numbers (i32s should work). I look into `map()` I've seen on this `Line` iterable I've got. I can write a lambda like `x.map(|n| n.foo())`, but unfortunately when I'm inside of a lambda I seem to lose my RLS intellisense. Pity.

And with that, I've moved the logic from the shell script into rust, even if I don't completely understand every line I've got. I feel it's not very idiomatic, especially in my treatment of Result and Option types. It'll come with time.

```rust
fn main() {
  let stdin = io::stdin();
  let input_modules = stdin
    .lock()
    .lines()
    .map(|l| l.unwrap().parse::<i32>().ok().expect(""));

  let mut sum: i32 = 0;

  // day 1 part 1, account for the fuel from the input_modules
  for n in input_modules {
    sum += get_required_fuel(n);
    println!("{:?} {:?}", n, sum);
  }

  // day 1 part 2, account for the fuel for the fuel, recursively
  println!("{}", get_required_fuel(sum));
}
```

A while later, I've written some of the ugliest code of my life, but I figured out how to get tests
working, thanks to https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html#the-anatomy-of-a-test-function , and I'm passing them based on the examples from the problem set. I like to think that if I were coming to the problem with fresh eyes my solution would be cleaner. The math here is quite straightforward, but I'm getting tripped up. I got the answer, though, and sometimes that's enough to move on.

## Day 2

I start with `cargo new day02`. I've got to write a calculator program!

Opcodes:

- 1 add
- 2 mul
- 99 halt

There's some additional details to how the registers work in the problem itself. This time I'm going to try doing it TDD style. I don't know much about how collections work, but something like a hash map should work for writing this calculator. I have the intuition that this is something that could be written super efficiently in a low-level language like rust, but for now I just want to get the right result, and keep learning rust at my limited level.

When scaffolding out my tests, I'm confused why I get an error message:

```
24 |     assert_eq!("2,3,0,6,99", calculate("2,3,0,3,99"));
   |                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |                                        |
   |                                        expected struct `std::string::String`, found reference
   |                                        help: try using a conversion method: `"2,3,0,3,99".to_string()`
```

`"foo".to_string()` looks really strange to me, but it works.

So I ended up using Vectors, which are a low-level construct like an array. I had some trouble indexing, so I searched some and I have to do some manual casting from i32 to usize, see https://users.rust-lang.org/t/is-there-a-way-to-allow-indexing-vec-by-i32-in-my-program/15755 . I also noticed my println statements aren't output when I run `cargo test` for passing tests, only for failing tests- I guess this is nice for keeping things clean.

For the second part, it was fairly easy to modify my program to search for inputs. The trickiest bit was figuring out how to breaK out of multiple levels of loops: it uses [named breaks](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22905752/named-breaks-in-for-loops-in-rust), similar to javascript.

At this point, the program is really inefficient parsing from strings every time, but so be it.

## day 3

This puzzel requires a couple of parts. One, I need to parse the paths as string input and then
draw them in a matrix. (I need to figure out what data tpe to use for a matrix in rust. `Vec<Vec<bool>>`?) Then, I need to find where they intersect to get a set of intersections. Last, I need to find the closet intersection in that set (minimum manhattan distance). This third part is easiest.

Manhattan distance, per wiki, is "the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates" which is to say, for a point (x, y) where x and y are positive integers, it's x + y.

I ended up going with a [HashSet](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashSet.html) of Points (a basic x,y struct I defined). There are helpful macros to implement a bunch of things I needed, giving:

```rust
#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Clone, Debug)]
struct Point {
  x: i32,
  y: i32,
}
```

This isn't the most memory-efficient data structure (less efficient than a bitmap), but it's really easy to work with for now, and my sizes are tiny. I intend on using set intersection to find my line
intersection- partially because my geometry is kind of rubbish, and it's easier for me to think in these terms, and again, my set sizes make the computation reasonable.

I implemented a function to parse the path strings and draw them to the HashSet, implementing a basic LOGO language, assuming the pen is always down.

Once I implemented that, intersecting the sets was really easy- `setA::interset(&setB)`. Then, finding the closest from that set of intersections was easy with `setA::min_by`. The tricky bit was figuring out how to write the lambda, using the [`std::cmp::Ordering` enum](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/enum.Ordering.html). Ultimately, I inlined it, using the `cmp` method from my `i32` expression.

Altogether:

```rust

fn main() {
  let path1 = parse("R1004...".to_string());
  let path2 = parse("L1008...".to_string());

  let intersections = path1.intersection(&path2);
  println!("intersections: {:?}", intersections);

  // What is the Manhattan distance from the central port to the closest intersection?

  let closest = intersections
    .min_by(|a, b| (a.x + a.y).cmp(&(b.x + b.y)))
    .unwrap();
  println!("closest: {:?}", closest);
}

```

Easy peasy!

Now, with the twist in part 2, where closest is based on length rather than geometric distance. A nice answer might keep track of the length for each point, changing my Point interface. However, I'm choosing to do a second function which will parse the path again and report the length once it hits a point, something like `get_length_at(path, point)`

The algorithmic part is straightforward. But now I'm running into what every rust newb confronts: fighting with the Borrow checker. These reference lifetimes are rough! In desperation, I try just making copies of the strings in my code. It's soooo awful. It still doesn't work. Ugh.

Ultimately I got it to work. It took a few tries, mostly because in my various efforts in shuffling the string around for the compiler, I forgot I had the `closest` part commented out, and submitted an arbitrary point's distance instead.

At this point, some things I'd refactor: extract a visitor for the logo parser, maybe add some higher-level functions that mirror what the examples gave, and maybe wrap up the paths into a context object (struct).

### Day 4

Alright, let's implement a constraint fuzzer! I need to find the injective set for the domain given that matches the rules. I'm going to implement a predicate function for the rules and then iterate over the set. Should be easy (famous last words).

Two of the rules can be eliminated, since the given domain is all 6-digit numbers, and all within the given domain.

I had a hard time with this one, for one, interpreting what the new rule even meant (english is hard!)
and for two, dealing with what sort of rust data structure to use. Should I use a Char iter? A Vector? All sorts of other little micro decisions to get wrong that I wouldn't have thought about with javascript, or even java. Eventually I got it. I'm not terribly happy.

### Day 5

This is extending day 3. For now, I just copy/pasted the relevant functions. At some point, if there's enough re-use, maybe I'll stop and figure out how rust modules work.

This led me down an exploration of rust enums. The code is a little messier, but not terrible! I added input params as a vector and explored multiple return values to capture the mutated memory and output effects. This got me to the answer for part 1.

For the extended opcodes, implementing them was very straightforward although now I'm feeling pressure to refactor how I'm going about parsing instruction parameters. I implemented a few tests, discovered I had missed advancing the instruction pointer, but once that was fixed, everything worked hunky dory.

### Day 6

We're dealing with trees (specifically, DAG). I need to find a good data representation (adjaceny matrix?).
